## Simple Shell Project

-----

### background
This is a work on designing our own shell program. This will imitate reguler bash/shell 
program on UNIX environment.

### steps
The skeleton vanilla program is provided during preparation of lab. This live version on 
GitHub is the modified and working one. One may have different approach on creating their own 
*shell*. 

### feature
My version of shell can do these:

* perform regular *sh*-like feature, e.g. perform executable on `/bin/`.
* react on common interrupt, `CTRL+C` and `CTRL-D`
* perform background task by spawning child tasks
* etc.

You may check line-by-line codes and please send inquiry to yanuart.adityan[at]gmail.com to 
give a comment or questions.
